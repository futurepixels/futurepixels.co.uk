When using [Git][], terminal can be more useful then you think. The best addition to this is to install [cheat sheet][] via [RubyGems][]. This can be done like so:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    [sudo] gem install cheat
{% endhighlight %}

Once installed you can

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    cheat git
{% endhighlight %}

A quick guide will be displayed for you to view for those times of need.

You can [learn][] Git within your browser on [Github.com][] which will give you an introduction to [Git][].

<h3 id="subsection:sourcetree" data-section="tools">Sourcetree</h3>

All functionality is as easy to use in terminal as it is in any GUI. However, there are times when the GUI gives you a better understanding of how certain methods and processes work.

[SourceTree][] is available for Windows, Linux and from the [App Store][] for the Mac.

It is something I have used for a while to get my head around [Git][] as it allowed me to picture the commands better.

<h1 id="section:clone-create-repo">Clone or create a repository</h1>

Cloning or creating a repository is as easy as 1,2,3 \*

To clone a repository:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repository>.git
{% endhighlight %}

<span class="micro">\* Providing you have access to the repository if the repository is not private.</span>

To create a repository:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git init
{% endhighlight %}

If you have cloned a repository, and you are contribute to a project, always work in your own [branches][]!

Once your repository has been created locally and is empty, set up the code base if you are using a framework. So,for example; if you were to work on a [jekyll][] project you would then run in your desired directory:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    jekyll new my-awesome-site
{% endhighlight %}

Then you would [Commit][] before working on the project so you can view the history of file or even revert to that point if needed.

<h1 id="section:basics">Basic functionality</h1>

<h3 id="subsection:branches" data-section="basics">Git branches</h3>

[Git][] branches are a way to create features on top of the code base without messing with the actual base of the project.

When working with [branches][] I personaly use the following as default:

* master \| prod
* acceptance \| uat
* testing \| test
* development \| dev

These will be the branches in which you merge into when dev for your dev server, then test for your testing server followed by <accr>User Acceptence Testing</accr> and then into your master branch for release.

<h3 id="subsection:pull" data-section="basics">Git pull</h3>

From pulling a new or empty repository, to updating the current repository, this will do a pull from the repository and get the latest version for the branch you are in like so:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git pull
{% endhighlight %}

Or, to get the whole repository, you do:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git pull --all
{% endhighlight %}

This is something that should be done an a regular basis when you are working continuous on a project, but is also just as important when creating new [branches][]

<h3 id="subsection:branches-management" data-section="basics">Branch management</h3>

Say we want a new feature or a bug fix, instead of working directly on the `master` branch of the project we create a new branch like so:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git checkout dev
    git pull
    git branch <branch-name>
    git checkout <branch-name>

{% endhighlight %}

or we can shorthand this by typing:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git checkout dev
    git pull
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have our branch we can make changes to the code base.

> \* Notice the `git checkout <dev>` and `git pull` at the start of the code block. This is a must as you want to ensure you get the latest code within the `dev` branch so you are working with up-to-date code for your bug fix or feature build.

<h3 id="subsection:add" data-section="basics">Git add</h3>

When you have made changes by changing current code or adding files, we need to add it to the staging area when we are happy with our local testing. We can do this by adding all files in one go:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git add *
{% endhighlight %}

> This is great to add all files in one go, but this is only relative to the directory you are in.

To add specific filenames, we can do the following, again depending where you are on the project tree, you may need to add the full path or `cd` to the root folder.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git add <filename> <filename>
{% endhighlight %}

Although considered bad practice to make multiple changes to a file or files for different issues or feature enhancements, you can find your self creating a feature by adding modifications that are related but not as one. 

For example; you create a feature that includes a config file and certain functions need to access the config file. However, you have created the `config.json` and modified 3 functions to access this config, tested it works and are ready to commit. If we add them all in one go and commit all in the staging area, it will be a pain and can cause difficulty to revert to a certain revision. As in this instance, reverting to this commit on production due to a bug can cause these functions to possibly break the site completely. So, instead of `git add *` we look at the code by adding in [hunks](#section:hunks) to further review the code before committing. 



<h3 id="subsection:commit" data-section="basics">Git commit</h3>

Once your files are added, we can now commit those changes by doing:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git commit -m "<your-message-message-here>"
{% endhighlight %}

For ease of reading commits by another developer, I've always said to write you commit message like so:

\-\-\-

git commit -m "Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: 'Fix bug' and not 'Fixed bug'
or 'Fixes bug'.  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.  
- Bullet points are okay, too  
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here  
- Use a hanging indent"

\-\-\-

This way you will be able to look back at bug and feature commits and know exactly what has happend.

<h3 id="subsection:merge" data-section="basics">Git Merge</h3>

Merging in its simplistic view is grabbing your amended code and merging into your working branch. For example, to merge your feature code into the working `dev` branch, your would:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git checkout dev
    git pull
    git merge <branch> --no-ff --no-commit
{% endhighlight %}

The options are

* --no-ff ##No Fast Forward: Combines all commits into one  
* --no-commit ##Merge but do not auto commit, great for merge conflicts and further tweaks

Instead of writing a load to explain the merge conflicts, read the post on [gitready merge][] for a better explanation.

<h3 id="subsection:hunks" data-section="basics">Git Hunks</h3>

The following `git diff` gives the changes that have been made:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git diff index.php 
    diff --git a/index.php b/index.php
    index 07464de..26f5539 100644

As per above, there are several changes in the file, but we only want to add the second section of changes in this commit:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git add -p <filename>
{% endhighlight %}

You will then be asked what you would like to do with this:

{% highlight bash linenos %}

We then select `y` and this section of the file changes will be shown in our staging area ready to commit.

When we do a `git status` you will see the file will be in both the `Changes to be commited:` and `Changes not staged for commit:`

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git status
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #

    #

    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #   modified:   index.php
    #
{% endhighlight %}

We can now commit the following changes only for the index file.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    -<footer>This is a foot</footer>
    +<footer>This is a footer</footer>
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="subsection:push" data-section="basics">Git push</h3>

When you have made you changes and are ready to test on another server or make it live, you would then push all commited changes back to the repository like so:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
    git push
{% endhighlight %}

<h1>Extra Activities</h1>

You can learn [git][] outside of, or before your project with [Github's][] [try github][]. Alternatively, you can create an empty folder and `git init` within the folder and play around without effecting any other git repo on your machine...
