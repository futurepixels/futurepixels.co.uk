# Thank you

This is simply a thank you to people, who have got me to where I am today, and are part of the PHP, HTML, CSS and other communities.

It is basically a list that would take a fair few tweets to do, so I wanted it in one place.

So, thank you to all the people at PHP Warwickshire and PHP East Midlands as they were the people who have encouraged me to do talks and helped with my initial confidence and my general progression/sanity as a developer.

I also want to thank the following people for helping. Whether it was time spent over IRC/Slack/Twitter/Email or even just writing a blog post that I have read or doing a project that has helped me to extend my knowledge.

 - Luke Steadweb
 - Ben Plummer
 - Mike Preston

Again, thank you.
