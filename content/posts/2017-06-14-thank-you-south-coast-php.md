There is no simpler way to say this, but thank you.

Thank you to all involved in all three PHP South Coast conferences. You have _all_ played a big part in who I am today as a software engineer. The speakers were fantastic and the organisers have been great!

On a personal level, I want to say thank you as PHP South Coast was my first conference back in 2015 after first getting involved with my local user group [PHP Warwickshire](http://phpwarks.co.uk). That year I also went to [PHP North West](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/) and [Symfony Live](http://london2016.live.symfony.com/). Since then my hunger for knowledge has grown and as a result my career has progressed.

Without these communities and the awesome people in them I would not be who I am today as a developer, granted not the best but I can understand more thanks to peoples time to offer talks for free or use their free time to speak at conferences over spending time with loved ones.

At the time of writing this, I am 2 weeks away from completing my first year at my current Employer and it has been so enjoyable and great after previous places of work. I am working with people who are just as like minded as people in the community and have fantastic attitudes which make them a pleasure to work with.

So, thank you to James and his team (sorry, I don't know who all of the speakers are) for creating such a memorable experience three years in a row. I have made new friends every year and pushed my self every year to talk to new people and ask questions without feeling like I was an idiot. You will be missed by many as a conference for the UK PHP community.
