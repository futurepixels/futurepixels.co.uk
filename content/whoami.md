Hi there, I'm Nigel, a developer, a father and fan of geeky stuff...

## Whoami as a developer...

A full time web developer for {{< years-in-service >}} years, I have started with very little knowledge and since then have being lucky to grow my knowledge to a variety of coding languages and practice's. I have a keen interest in Domain Driven Design, Test Driven Development, Behaviour Driven Development and having a mentor and professional like attitude both inside and outside of the workplace.

I believe of efficient coding, keeping to standards, exploring new technologies and helping others where I can.

## Whoami as just me...

When not coding, you will find me spending time with my daughter, listening to my music and trying to start on extending my vinyl/CD collection as well as getting outside with my camera.

## ...what about the site?

The site, well... originally built with [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki "The Jekyll Wiki"), a great tool for building static sites from (kinda) dynamic content whilst using [Inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com "The Inuit.css homepage") for the CSS, which "_is a Powerful, scalable, [Sass-based](http://sass-lang.com "The Sass Language homepage"), BEM, [OOCSS framework](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/ "An Introduction To Object Oriented CSS OOCSS at smashingmagazine.com")"_ and love of coding.

Since then I have re-written the site in [Hugo](gohugo.io), another static site generator but written in GoLang. This time I cheated and used a theme, the [Cocoa Eh Theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme/). I've also changed text editor too, I now use [Vim](https://www.vim.org).
