Hi there, I'm Nigel, a developer, a father and fan of geeky stuff...

A full time web developer for {{< years-in-service >}} years, I have started with very little knowledge and since then have being lucky to grow my knowledge to a variety of coding languages and practice's. I have a keen interest in Domain Driven Design, Test Driven Development, Behaviour Driven Development and having a mentor and professional like attitude both inside and outside of the workplace.

I believe in efficient coding, keeping to standards, exploring new technologies and helping others where I can.

Mentoring is a core value to me, both in my proffesion and personal life. It is something that works two ways for me where I get to share knowledge, as well as gain it from everyone around me.
