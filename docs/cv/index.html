    Curriculum Vitae: Nigel Greenway

</div>
            <div class="markdown">
                
    <p>As a Lead Software Engineer, I look to see what can be done to deliver what is needed whilst thinking about the end user first and then what impact it will have on the business. Dealing with requirements from the business, I help get solution with a skilled team and deliver value in iterations.</p>
<p>I am a believer in single source of truth around digital journeys with knowledge bases to help empower the team and business so everyone has a keen interest in helping each other as well as using the skills available to ensure the right product is delivered. Being customer centric I ensure I listen to the advice of User Experience as well as the Product Owner to ensure I deliver something we can learn from as a business and listen to the customer.</p>
<p>I am passionate about being able to deliver products and features fast enough to make a difference and to learn from, yet in a timely manner where the user experience is focused on with the sign off from a quality assurance team - where all people involved have the chance to say they are not happy with the quality and either push back or put something in the back log to refine or set a value against.</p>
<p>To allow a decent delivery I very much believe in a pipeline for continuous integration - but not only that, I believe continuous deployment can help where monitoring is at the forefront to give you the confidence that you can deploy on a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>As a lead, I am enthusiastic and a team player. I would never ask of anyone something that I wouldn&rsquo;t do myself. I believe transparency and fairness is key to a great team which is a key to a successful product being delivered. I like to ensure everyone gets on with each other and to understand we are in it together.</p>
<p>I understand to be able to release and iterate on a product and learn fast and fail fast you need to be quick at implementing them changes. This means a good code base that&rsquo;s easy to understand and read when you are context switching through the day between pieces of work. This takes a team effort as well as agility to enable this.</p>
<h3 id="whoami">Whoami</h3>
<p>I am a passionate engineer who takes pride in what he delivers. In my spare time I am listening to music, taking my daughter out on the bikes or teaching her skateboarding. If I&rsquo;m not doing that, I&rsquo;m learning how to use my camera, playing games or nerding/writing on my PC to reflect on what I&rsquo;ve learned or pushing my skill sets. I am infallible and can make mistakes. I admit when I&rsquo;m wrong and question things I don&rsquo;t know or am uncertain of. The chances are when I&rsquo;m at my desk my headphones are on, and are probably too loud.</p>
<p>Above all, I am loyal and get excited with a good team.</p>
<p>Please also read any recommendations I have via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-greenway-a5710a45/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://futurepixels.co.uk/whoami">read more</a> about me too&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>
<p>My skills have adapted and changed over the years. I understand a language should be used for certain tasks and there is not a one size fits all. This is the same for best practice and methodologies. Having worked slightly with Terraform, GoLang and Rust, I can see the benefits of infrastructure as code as well as using GoLang and Rust to help with certain tasks or tool chains.</p>

<h3 id="open-source-contribution">Open Source Contribution</h3>
<p>With the many methodologies around, one of the most important to me is the open source community. I try to take this approach when leading on projects to ensure you code for the next person/team to pick up a feature that might be added to a micro front end or service the team have created. These skills have been gained mainly when working on open-source projects along side respected people within the PHP Community for projects like <a href="https://thephpleague.com/" target="_blank">The PHP League</a>. Some of my projects can be seen below:</p>

<h3 id="employment">Employment</h3>
<h4 id="shell-energy-first-utility-2016-2019-_2016---present_">Shell Energy (First Utility 2016-2019) <em>(2016 - present)</em></h4>
<p>Since my time at Shell Energy (Formally First Utility) I have been able to work with many great and talented people. Starting as a Software Engineer, I was brought in to help with the main functionality of the web site, I helped deliver new features to the system as well as bug fixes. This was a monolithic PHP MVC application using Symfony and Zend components via Composer and based on the Yii framework as a base. Since then I&rsquo;ve supported team members with bigger features and worked to become a Senior Software Engineer and to my current role of a Lead Software Engineer.</p>
<p>My role of Lead Software Engineer has pushed me out of my comfort where I lead a team of software, UX, QA and API engineers to help deliver the right and best
digital experience for our user base. Whether this is a new web app or a complete re-platforming of current systems, I try ensure that the team have the right tools and information to hand and ensure MVP&rsquo;s are sensibly set. Working closely with the team I ensure we deliver value to both the customer and the business. We deliver apps that are delivering value instantly. Once the initial app is delivered we iterate as a team and deploy multiple changes which are driven by data taken from our internal analytic&rsquo;s and data collated from UX via our feedback and insight from the customer.</p>
<h4 id="presto-classical-ltd-_2014---2016_">Presto Classical Ltd <em>(2014 - 2016)</em></h4>
<p>My first task was to build an internal application to deal with how the business handles purchase orders with suppliers. Since then, I worked on rewriting the current website by converting the current procedural code into a fully object orientated application based on Domain Driven Design.</p>
<p>Within the first year, I have implemented Jenkins, a git work flow, PHPUnit and Test Driven Design along with documenting everything from code to hardware assets to requirement specifications using Dokuwiki. Working with the front end developer, I have implemented build scripts to ease the compiling of CSS from SASS, installing all server-side/front-end assets and browser-sync to allow testing of multiple devices with ease, media queries and front end functionality.</p>
<p>Technically, I have designed the architecture for the new site and business application with ADR, CQRS and DDD whilst implementing <a href="http://stackphp.com/">StackPHP</a> for the core whilst using packages from <a href="https://thephpleague.com/">The PHP League</a> and other resources as well as building our own or contributing to projects where they can aid in easing our development.</p>
<h4 id="resource-development-international-ltd-_2012---2014_">Resource Development International Ltd <em>(2012 - 2014)</em></h4>
<p>Based in Coventry, RDI are an on-line educational company that delivers university qualifications worldwide.</p>
<p>It is here where I have been able to extend my knowledge even further due to a great team. It is here I have been able to pick up knowledge on best practice, coding standards, knowledge of languages and further myself as a better and efficient developer.</p>
<p>Since arriving here, I have had the opportunity to create modifications and enhancements to the internal system which is based on the Symfony2 framework whilst working with Git for the version control. I have also had the pleasure of creating small business web tools to help with importing/exporting data, conversion of flash based questionnaires to pure HTML using JavaScript to work with the current data and be involved with 2 separate releases of our sales site.</p>
<p>I have also had chance to work on our Moodle platform by creating modifications, help with the theming of the new site and extend on the API connectors between our internal system and Moodle platform.</p>
<h4 id="caroco-marketing-ltd-_2011---2012_">Caroco Marketing Ltd <em>(2011 - 2012)</em></h4>
<p>Originally just based in Birmingham, Caroco Marketing specialised on web marketing from PPC, SEO, web design, social media services and the alike.</p>
<p>My time at Caroco Marketing gave me the chance to jump into project management and start working directly with my first PHP Framework; Symfony2. It gave me the chance to understand what is needed when planning a large project along with how to prioritise certain tasks with both immediate and higher level managers.</p>
<p>Throughout working for Caroco, I was asked to build a web app to improve business efficiency with the help of API&rsquo;s to feed information into our custom CRM along with creating short scripts to work with Google API&rsquo;s to import data into our custom reporting system.</p>
<p>On the odd occasion I would also be asked to either modify current client web sites or create new ones with the typo3 micro cms framework.</p>
<h4 id="itc-ltd-_2010---2011_">ITC Ltd <em>(2010 - 2011)</em></h4>
<p>ITC Ltd was a company who provided probate services based in Stratford-Upon-Avon.</p>
<p>I was part of a team that created modifications for the internal system or modified existing ones, along with bug fixing. The systems were custom built and were a collection of customer and document management web applications built with PHP.</p>
<p>Through each modification given, there was a process I learnt and found to be of great value to a developer; create the modification to the specification given, test locally and report on the test process in order for this to be passed to the test team and then liaise with the user acceptance team for further tweaks/modifications before being signed off and released.</p>
<p>Starting out as junior developer; this was my first roll in the world of development. Then, at the age of 26 I wanted a career I can excel in and gain rewards on a basis I can control, be that daily, weekly or monthly. Here, I learnt PHP at a deeper level and started to move from procedural code to the MVC pattern but on a basic level.</p>
