<h1 id="setting-up-git">Setting up Git</h1>

<h2 id="installing-git">Installing Git</h2>

<p>There are few ways to install <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> on a mac (I will eventually add guides on Windows and Linux).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Install <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a> (and install the command line tools for an added bonus)
<em>Simply install via the App Store App.</em></p></li>

<li><p>Install via <a href="http://brew.sh/">brew</a>
<em>Providing you have <a href="http://brew.sh/">brew</a> installed (installation instructions on the site), then; once installed run <code>[sudo] brew install git</code></em></p></li>

<li><p>Download direct from <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">git-scm.com</a>
<em>As it say&rsquo;s on the tin, download and install.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have found your way of installing <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, do a simple test buy running <code>git status</code> which should then return:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
</code></pre>

<h2 id="setting-up-git-1">Setting up Git</h2>

<p>Setting up <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> in it&rsquo;s simplist form is adding your user credentials:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git config --global user.name &quot;Joe Smith&quot;
git config --global user.email &quot;joe@smith.com&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also also change/add configs within your .gitconfig file which on a Mac can be found in your home directory <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. For an example, your can <a href="https://github.com/smilinmonki666/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig">view</a> mine for extra basic configurable options.</p>

<h3 id="usefull-tools">Usefull tools</h3>

<h4 id="command-line">Command line</h4>

<p>When using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, terminal can be more useful then you think. The best addition to this is to install <a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/git">cheat sheet</a> via <a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a>. This can be installed by running <code>[sudo] gem install cheat</code>. Once installed you simply run <code>cheat git</code> and it displays the document in vi mode. In this, I mean you use arrow up/down to navigate.</p>

<p>A quick guide will be displayed for you to view for those times of need.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">learn</a> Git within your browser on <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> which will give you an introduction to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.</p>

<h4 id="sourcetree">Sourcetree</h4>

<p>All functionality is as easy to use in terminal as it is in any GUI. However, there are times when the GUI gives you a better understanding of how certain methods and processes work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> is available for Windows, Linux and from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sourcetree-git-hg/id411678673?mt=12">App Store</a> for the Mac.</p>

<p>It is something I have used for a while to get my head around <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> as it allowed me to picture the commands better.</p>

<h3 id="clone-or-create-a-repository">Clone or create a repository</h3>

<h4 id="creating-a-repository">Creating a repository</h4>

<p>Creating a repository is as simple as <code>git init</code> within the desired directory. From there you would create files and <a href="#section:add">Add</a> then <a href="#section:commit">Commit</a> to your repository.</p>

<p>An example of this would be:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m &quot;Add Readme file for instructions&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Once created, I would suggest creating your <a href="#section:branches">branches</a>. That way you will be able to start getting into a workflow and used to switching between branches.</p>

<h4 id="cloning-a-repository">Cloning a repository</h4>

<p>To clone a repository (Assuming you are using <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a>) run the following in directory you want the project to be stored:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone git@github.com:{username}/{repository}.git
</code></pre>

<p><em>When using <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> as your hosting for your repository, I would suggest following this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">guide</a>.</em></p>

<p>Once you have cloned a repository always work in your own <a href="#section:branches">branches</a> so you don&rsquo;t work in a working repository.</p>

<h5 id="sidenote">Sidenote</h5>

<p>If your repository has been created locally and is empty, set up the code base if you are using a framework.</p>

<p>So,for example; if you were to work on a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> project you would then run in your desired directory <code>jekyll new my-awesome-site</code>.</p>

<p>Then you would <a href="#section:commit">Commit</a> before working on the project so you can view the history of file or even revert to that point if needed.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/my/project/path
git init
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m &quot;Add Readme file for instructions&quot;
git checkout -b dev
jekyll new my-awesome-site
git add *
git commit -m &quot;Add initial code base of jekyll&quot;
git push
</code></pre>

<h3 id="basic-functionality">Basic functionality</h3>

<h4 id="git-branches">Git branches</h4>

<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> branches are a way to create features on top of the code base without messing with the actual base of the project.</p>

<p>When working with <a href="#section:branches">branches</a> I personaly use the following as default:</p>

<ul>
<li>master &ndash;or&ndash; prod</li>
<li>acceptance &ndash;or&ndash; uat</li>
<li>testing &ndash;or&ndash; test</li>
<li>development &ndash;or&ndash; dev</li>
</ul>

<p>These will be the branches in which you merge into when dev for your dev server, then test for your testing server followed by <abbr title="User Acceptence Testing">UAT</abbr> and then into your master branch for release.</p>

<h4 id="git-pull">Git pull</h4>

<p><code>git pull</code> will update your current repository to match that of the remote repository. In this, I mean it will <code>git fetch</code> and then <code>git merge</code> the remote changes into your local copy of the repository. This is fine if you are wanting to update your local copy.</p>

<p>A good example of this would be if you have finished your recent changes to &lsquo;my-great-new-feature&rsquo; and you want to create a new [branch][] called &lsquo;even-better-feature&rsquo;. You would simply <code>git checkout dev</code> (or your main working branch) and then <code>git pull</code>. You can then <code>git checkout -b even-better-feature</code> and rock on with your new feature code.</p>

<p>Do not use this if you want to [fetch][] the changes from remote to local without running the risk of merging remote files into local files you have already changed.</p>

<h4 id="git-fetch">Git fetch</h4>

<p><code>git fetch</code> is the safer way of managing your repository when working with a <abbr title="Term used when the repository has modified, deleted or added files">dirty</abbr> repository. For example, you are half way through a modification which will could possibly be affected by a change made by another team member, without running the risk of changing anyfiles you have worked on, you would run <code>git fetch</code> on your <abbr title="Term used when the repository has modified, deleted or added files">dirty</abbr> repository knowing you are safe from any unwanted merges.</p>

<h4 id="branch-management">Branch management</h4>

<p>Say we want a new feature or a bug fix, instead of working directly on the <code>master</code> branch of the project we create a new branch like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout dev
git pull
git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;
git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or we can shorthand this by typing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have our branch we can make changes to the code base.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>* Notice the <code>git checkout &lt;dev&gt;</code> and <code>git pull</code> at the start of the code block. This is a must as you want to ensure you get the latest code within the <code>dev</code> branch so you are working with up-to-date code for your bug fix or feature build.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="git-add">Git add</h4>

<p>When you have made changes by changing current code or adding files, we need to add it to the staging area when we are happy with our local testing. We can do this by adding all files in one go:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git add *
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great to add all files in one go, but this is only relative to the directory you are in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To add specific filenames, we can do the following, again depending where you are on the project tree, you may need to add the full path or <code>cd</code> to the root folder.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git add &lt;filename&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Although considered bad practice to make multiple changes to a file or files for different issues or feature enhancements, you can find your self creating a feature by adding modifications that are related but not as one.</p>

<p>For example; you create a feature that includes a config file and certain functions need to access the config file. However, you have created the <code>config.json</code> and modified 3 functions to access this config, tested it works and are ready to commit. If we add them all in one go and commit all in the staging area, it will be a pain and can cause difficulty to revert to a certain revision. As in this instance, reverting to this commit on production due to a bug can cause these functions to possibly break the site completely. So, instead of <code>git add *</code> we look at the code by adding in <a href="#section:hunks">hunks</a> to further review the code before committing.</p>

<h4 id="git-commit">Git commit</h4>

<p>Once your files are added, we can now commit those changes by doing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git commit -m &quot;&lt;your-message-message-here&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>For ease of reading commits by another developer, I&rsquo;ve always said to write you commit message like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git commit -m &quot;Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72 characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: 'Fix bug' and not 'Fixed bug' or 'Fixes bug'.  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.`

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
 - Bullet points are okay, too
 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
 - Use a hanging indent&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This way you will be able to look back at bug and feature commits and know exactly what has happend.</p>

<h4 id="git-merge">Git merge</h4>

<p>Merging in its simplistic view is grabbing your amended code and merging into your working branch. For example, to merge your feature code into the working <code>dev</code> branch, your would:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout dev
git pull
git merge &lt;branch&gt; --no-ff --no-commit
</code></pre>

<p>The options are</p>

<ul>
<li>&ndash;no-ff <em>:No Fast Forward. Combines all commits into one</em></li>
<li>&ndash;no-commit <em>:Merge but do not auto commit, great for merge conflicts and further tweaks</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of writing a load to explain the merge conflicts, read the post on <a href="http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/25/branching-and-merging.html">gitready merge</a> for a better explanation.</p>

<h4 id="git-hunks">Git hunks</h4>

<p>The following <code>git diff</code> gives the changes that have been made:</p>

<pre><code class="language-diff">git diff index.php
