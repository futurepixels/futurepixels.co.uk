    <p>Over the weekend I updated my favourite rolling release of my Linux distro, <a href="https://getsol.us/blog/">Solus-Project</a>. I looked through the updates, like I always do and seen there were some updates - one including the Linux kernel! Later that day I shut the PC down and went about the rest of my day.</p>
<p>Yesterday I needed to get back on my PC to do something and it wasn&rsquo;t booting - God damn it! Not all is lost though, this is Linux and with the power of Linux there is <em>something</em> out there on the big web that can help - before I use my small circle of friends if they&rsquo;ve had this.</p>
<p>After some searching on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DDG</a> I found the command I was trying to get to for when booting failed once it passed the boot screen and boot loader - <code>ctrl+alt+F2</code>. Once I logged in with my normal user credentials I found <a href="https://getsol.us/articles/troubleshooting/general-troubleshooting/en/">this</a> article on the Solus Project help forum and run the suggested command; <code>CBM_DEBUG=1 clr-boot-manager update</code>. This allowed me to run the <code>update</code> command and get the debug output I needed - thank you to people who add good logging!</p>
<p>The results shown that there was no space on my device&hellip; odd. Then the dredd hit me - I didn&rsquo;t set the boot partion to a large size, because.. well I thought it would be fine. The size you ask, it was 512Mb&hellip; I know.</p>
<p>So as I dual boot, I booted into my Windows partion downloaded <a href="https://rufus.ie">Rufus</a> and the <a href="https://getsol.us/download/">Solus-Project ISO</a> and set them to work together to create me a bootable USB. Once booted I tried to re-size my partition labeled <code>BOOT</code> and quickly found &hellip; I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Next step, purge the old versions. I thought that <code>clr-boot-manager</code> would have a command to purge something by date or &ldquo;keep recent versions&rdquo; but it doesn&rsquo;t have that:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ clr-boot-manager -h
Usage: clr-boot-manager

        version - Print the version and quit
  report-booted - Report the current kernel as successfully booted
           help - Show help message
         update - Perform post-update configuration of the system
    set-timeout - Set the timeout to be used by the bootloader
    get-timeout - Get the timeout to be used by the bootloader
     set-kernel - Configure kernel to be used at next boot
   list-kernels - Display currently selectable kernels to boot

Options:
  -p, --path           Set the base path for boot management operations.
  -i, --image          Force clr-boot-manager to run in image mode.
  -n, --no-efi-update  Don't update efi vars when using shim-systemd backend.
</code></pre><p>So, I had to do it myself. Boot into my USB drive and the Solus Live image worked a treat -</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo su
mount /dev/MY_BOOT_PARTITION /boot
xdg-open /boot
</code></pre><p>In here had all my boot partitions under <code>/EFI</code>. Once I am in there <code>com.solus-project</code> and then change to a list view and order by most recent. Here I could remove the oldest ones from the past few years. Once that was done I needed to set the kernel to the latest version with <code>clr-boot-manager set-kernel com.solus-project.current.5.10.15.172</code> (find your available kernels with <code>clr-boot-manager list-kernels</code> - the one with the <code>*</code> on the left is the one that is set).</p>
<p>Once done, <code>reboot now</code> and all works again!</p>
<p>The lesson I was taught here; set something more sensible for the boot partition - 512Mb is just stupid when using a rolling release. The bonus is if I do need to re-install Linux (and Windows in tthis case) then I have a partition <code>/home</code> so that wouldn&rsquo;t be affected - my Windows partition would though from what I can tell&hellip;</p>
