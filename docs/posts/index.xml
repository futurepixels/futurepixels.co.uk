      <title>Setting up automated releases with Gitlab pipelines</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Gitlab for a good few years now, and I can honestly say they&amp;rsquo;ve nailed it. Not only is it Open Source &amp;amp; paid for, but they&amp;rsquo;ve managed to encapsulate the tooling, workflow and processes all under one roof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get the holy grail of &lt;del&gt;automation&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;dev ops&lt;/del&gt; git-ops: ensuring manual intervention for releases in as little - or non-existing, as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;let-me-set-the-scene&#34;&gt;Let me set the scene.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are knee deep in focus with an interesting problem to solve, debugging something that&amp;rsquo;s been bugging you for ages or just in the flow of crafting your code in your project. Now come&amp;rsquo;s along that notification in Slack, Discord, email, what ever else is there to grab you out of your flow telling your that &amp;ldquo;PRODUCTION IS DOWN&amp;rdquo; (or that pesky project manager/product owner asking to &amp;ldquo;INVESTIGATE THIS COOL IDEA!&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using --legacy-peer-deps in NodeJS</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;let-me-set-the-scene&#34;&gt;Let me set the scene…&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this, I&amp;rsquo;d have been writing code for a little over two decades. Professionally, I have been doing it for fourteen years, and the past two years I have been working purely in the wonderful land of JavaScript as both a senior software engineer and then a lead engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why is this important? Well, two weeks ago I was doing a routine update on bumping versions of our NPM packages - as an engineer I understand that keeping packages up-to-date is good practice for reasons like being able to use the latest API’s from packages, as well as ensuring any security holes are filled in when a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-cve&#34;&gt;CVE&lt;/a&gt;] is created. I have been really keen to keep the code I maintain up-to-date so I know that I am lowering the risk of both the company I work for as well as our clients. Not a bad way to think, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The golden moment of a Friday delivery in software</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having been in software engineering for around 15 years, there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk around Friday deployments - in that you should be able to do them without worries. This is all well and good, but there are some things that you need, and steps you need to make in order to get to the &amp;ldquo;holy grail&amp;rdquo; of software delivery in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a recent discussion with someone in our team, it was suggested that they&amp;rsquo;d be more comfortable to wait to deploy on a Monday and not at 4:30 on a sunny Friday afternoon&amp;hellip; understandable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I found focusing a real struggle. With distractions everywhere as a kid, it taught me bad habits. As I grew up, I found my mind wandering with mental distractions like thinking about things non important to me at that time, like what I was doing that evening or wondering something obscure&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years however, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to really change that with many things like various online tools like Google Keep, Google Tasks, SimpleNote and Notion and of course physical notebooks, as well as reading self help books and talking to various nerdy friends about it&amp;hellip; however, the one thing that occurred to me a few years back is my desk set up. I always felt like I was trapped, closed in or distracted with something whilst sitting at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adding a mount point on boot under Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with linux over the past few years has been fun but it certainly comes with it&amp;rsquo;s frustrations. One of them for me is having to mount the drive when I need it, but this is because its not been that important to me to learn. So, tonight I decided to do a bit of reading up about it and learn then put that learning in to place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For myself, I have two drives I would like to mount on boot as it would in Windows and macOS; &amp;ldquo;Linux Games&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Media&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend I updated my favourite rolling release of my Linux distro, &lt;a href=&#34;https://getsol.us/blog/&#34;&gt;Solus-Project&lt;/a&gt;. I looked through the updates, like I always do and seen there were some updates - one including the Linux kernel! Later that day I shut the PC down and went about the rest of my day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I needed to get back on my PC to do something and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t booting - God damn it! Not all is lost though, this is Linux and with the power of Linux there is &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; out there on the big web that can help - before I use my small circle of friends if they&amp;rsquo;ve had this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part two of a series. Go read &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/becoming-a-lead-part-1-the-prelude/&#34;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt; if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months we would finish a project which was one of the best projects I was involved in. This was lead by my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/leigh-mills-606b8b68/&#34;&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve very much been mentored my Leigh the past four years and he has taught me a lot around aspects of my role as an engineer. During this project I pushed for various things within our team; detailed mocks, accessibility as well as other things. This put us in a good state but looking back it wasn&amp;rsquo;t implemented correctly, however we were lean and very much a team that embraced continuous improvements&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;prelude&#34;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The past year has been a roller-coaster - for me at least&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in September 2019, I was promoted to &amp;ldquo;Lead Software Engineer&amp;rdquo;. This was a role I was very much excited about, for many reasons - but one reason stood out the most. This was that I was able to help make a difference to my team, the business and more importantly the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me - and knows me well, understands that I am pretty passionate about what I do so I took this seriously but not in a way where I told everyone that they were wrong and we are doing it my way. They also understand I can loose focus on the end goal to a large extent and help too many people which impacts on my own targets/goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up Rancher (with Digital Ocean)</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-rancher&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-rancher&#34; id=&#34;what-is-rancher&#34;&gt;What is Rancher?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rancher.com&#34;&gt;Rancher&lt;/a&gt; comes in two parts (the first being optional). You have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rancher.com/rancher-os/&#34;&gt;Rancher Distro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/&#34;&gt;Rancher Orchestration Tool&lt;/a&gt; (I am currently using 1.6, which is where the docs point too).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first part is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rancher.com/rancher-os/&#34;&gt;Rancher Distro&lt;/a&gt;. This is pretty awesome. I know, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;another distro&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; I can hear you say - but this is pretty clever: it is a distro for &lt;a href=&#34;https://docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;. It is built entirely on Docker in that you can replace the core parts of the system with a simple command which swaps the core part out by stopping the current Docker container with the new option running in Docker. Want to use the Debian, Ubuntu or Centos console for example, you can do. Configuration is easy enough too as it uses a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud-init.io&#34;&gt;cloud-init&lt;/a&gt; based configuration which is a standard for system templates. &lt;em&gt;Note that this won&amp;rsquo;t be required in this walk through.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying it out for about 6 to 8 months and finding it very well thought out and fully featured. The main bonus is that you can host it yourself so your code can be truly private and controlled. The features I&amp;rsquo;m using for my pipeline are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have a HP MicroServer which allowed me to practice on but I was fed up of running a server from home with running both a server and a nameserver. So, after much playing around I decided to have a play around with &lt;a href=&#34;https://m.do.co/c/7ceb48d8e994&#34;&gt;Digital Ocean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no simpler way to say this, but thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all involved in all three PHP South Coast conferences. You have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; played a big part in who I am today as a software engineer. The speakers were fantastic and the organisers have been great!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, I want to say thank you as PHP South Coast was my first conference back in 2015 after first getting involved with my local user group &lt;a href=&#34;http://phpwarks.co.uk&#34;&gt;PHP Warwickshire&lt;/a&gt;. That year I also went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/&#34;&gt;PHP North West&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://london2016.live.symfony.com/&#34;&gt;Symfony Live&lt;/a&gt;. Since then my hunger for knowledge has grown and as a result my career has progressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a few articles on this, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/experience/coming-of-age-as-a-php-developer&#34;&gt;Coming of age as a PHP developer&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/experience/being-a-professional-developer&#34;&gt;Being a professional developer&lt;/a&gt;. I have also presented a talk to two local user groups about this exact issue, which was great and had more outcome on the conversations and questions afterwards than I thought it would.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That, as well as logging into the wrong server can cause lost time and on them rare occasions, headaches caused by working on the wrong server. It happens. It&amp;rsquo;s not something just done by junior sys admins. When you are under stress or just simply not concentrating on what you are doing, you will make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;editing-the-latest-commit&#34;&gt;Editing the latest commit:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;The following tip is about changing previous commits. If these commits are pushed to the remote, I would strongly advise to not mess with your history as it could break stuff&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pretty easy to do so as stated on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-the-Last-Commit&#34;&gt;git scm book#Changing the last commit&lt;/a&gt;. But a quick overview shows the simplicity:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git commit --amend &amp;quot;Your new message&amp;quot;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;editing-a-commit-earlier-in-your-commit-history&#34;&gt;Editing a commit earlier in your commit history&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is great for the last commit message you just created, but what about a message type of reword that is after your latest commit message.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;thank-you&#34;&gt;Thank you&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is simply a thank you to people, who have got me to where I am today, and are part of the PHP, HTML, CSS and other communities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is basically a list that would take a fair few tweets to do, so I wanted it in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, thank you to all the people at PHP Warwickshire and PHP East Midlands as they were the people who have encouraged me to do talks and helped with my initial confidence and my general progression/sanity as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have now been a Mac OS user for around 8 years now. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I have enjoyed using it. However, I have recently wanted to change for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first;&lt;/em&gt; I want to advance on my skills as a developer/devops, so I feel like using a pure Linux operating system will help with that in regards to being familiar with the OS, structure, kernel and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something I touched on briefly in my last post, &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://futurepixels.co.uk/experience/coming-of-age-as-a-php-developer/#from-junior-to-now&#34;&gt;Coming of age as a php developer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;, but it is something I would like to extend on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-people-expect-from-a-developer&#34;&gt;What do people expect from a developer?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every one has a different view of what to expect from a developer. Me, personally, I expect to be able to approach another developer and gain knowledge from them as well as be able to ask questions or suggest a possible solution to a problem without being treated like I suggested setting up a production server and allowing everyone to use &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; as the login user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Coming of age as a PHP developer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, I was fortunate to find an advert in the paper for a junior PHP developer. I had been using PHP for around a year at this point. I had not been to University or collage to learn any programming, it was all self taught. I applied and was a successful candidate and worked there for just over a year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;me-a-junior-cool&#34;&gt;Me, a junior? Cool!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had only really been a hobby developer in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Self management</title>

Although my knowledge has improved to a certain degree, along with my workflow, my self management however has got no better. Sure, you can have all the tools you need and within the 4 years (at the time of writing this) of my commercial experience, I think I have only just found the tools that suit me best and I am still learning new tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
