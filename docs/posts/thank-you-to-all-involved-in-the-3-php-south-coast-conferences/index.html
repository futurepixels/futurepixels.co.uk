    <p>There is no simpler way to say this, but thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you to all involved in all three PHP South Coast conferences. You have <em>all</em> played a big part in who I am today as a software engineer. The speakers were fantastic and the organisers have been great!</p>

<p>On a personal level, I want to say thank you as PHP South Coast was my first conference back in 2015 after first getting involved with my local user group <a href="http://phpwarks.co.uk">PHP Warwickshire</a>. That year I also went to <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/">PHP North West</a> and <a href="http://london2016.live.symfony.com/">Symfony Live</a>. Since then my hunger for knowledge has grown and as a result my career has progressed.</p>

<p>Without these communities and the awesome people in them I would not be who I am today as a developer, granted not the best but I can understand more thanks to peoples time to offer talks for free or use their free time to speak at conferences over spending time with loved ones.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this, I am 2 weeks away from completing my first year at my current Employer and it has been so enjoyable and great after previous places of work. I am working with people who are just as like minded as people in the community and have fantastic attitudes which make them a pleasure to work with.</p>

<p>So, thank you to James and his team (sorry, I don&rsquo;t know who all of the speakers are) for creating such a memorable experience three years in a row. I have made new friends every year and pushed my self every year to talk to new people and ask questions without feeling like I was an idiot. You will be missed by many as a conference for the UK PHP community.</p>
