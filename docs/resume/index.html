<h4 id="presto-classical-ltd-_2014---2016_">Presto Classical Ltd <em>(2014 - 2016)</em></h4>
<p>My first task was to build an internal application to deal with how the business handles purchase orders with suppliers. Since then, I have been working on rewriting the current website by converting the current procedural code into a fully object orientated application based on Domain Driven Design.</p>
<p>Within the first year, I have implemented Jenkins, a git work flow, PHPUnit and Test Driven Design along with documenting everything from code to hardware assets to requirement specifications using Dokuwiki. Working with the front end developer, I have implemented build scripts to ease the compiling of CSS from SASS, installing all server-side/front-end assets and browser-sync to allow testing of multiple devices with ease, media queries and front end functionality.</p>
<p>Technically, I have designed the architecture for the new site and business application with ADR, CQRS and DDD whilst implementing <a href="http://stackphp.com/">StackPHP</a> for the core whilst using packages from <a href="https://thephpleague.com/">The PHP League</a> and other resources as well as building our own or contributing to projects where they can aid in easing our development.</p>

<h4 id="resource-development-international-ltd-_2012---2014_">Resource Development International Ltd <em>(2012 - 2014)</em></h4>
<p>Based in Coventry, RDI are an on-line educational company that delivers university qualifications worldwide.</p>
<p>It is here where I have been able to extend my knowledge even further due to a great team. It is here I have been able to pick up knowledge on best practice, coding standards, knowledge of languages and further myself as a better and efficient developer.</p>
<p>Since arriving here, I have had the opportunity to create modifications and enhancements to the internal system which is based on the Symfony2 framework whilst working with Git for the version control. I have also had the pleasure of creating small business web tools to help with importing/exporting data, conversion of flash based questionnaires to pure HTML using javascript to work with the current data and be involved with 2 seperate releases of our sales site.</p>
<p>I have also had chance to work on our Moodle platform by creating modifications, help with the theming of the new site and extend on the API connectors between our internal system and Moodle platform.</p>

<h4 id="caroco-marketing-ltd-_2011---2012_">Caroco Marketing Ltd <em>(2011 - 2012)</em></h4>
<p>Originally just based in Birmingham, Caroco Marketing specialised on web marketing from PPC, SEO, web design, social media services and the alike.</p>
<p>My time at Caroco Marketing gave me the chance to jump into project management and start working directly with my first PHP Framework; Symfony2. It gave me the chance to understand what is needed when planning a large project along with how to prioritise certain tasks with both immediate and higher level managers.</p>
<p>Throughout working for Caroco, I was asked to build a web app to improve business efficiency with the help of API&rsquo;s to feed information into our custom CRM along with creating short scripts to work with Google API&rsquo;s to import data into our custom reporting system.</p>
<p>On the odd occasion I would also be asked to either modify current client web sites or create new ones with the typo3 micro cms framework.</p>

<h4 id="itc-ltd-_2010---2011_">ITC Ltd <em>(2010 - 2011)</em></h4>
<p>ITC Ltd was a company who provided probate services based in Stratford-Upon-Avon.</p>
<p>I was part of a team that created modifications for the internal system or modified existing ones, along with bug fixing. The systems were custom built and were a collection of customer and document management web applications built with PHP.</p>
<p>Through each modification given, there was a process I learnt and found to be of great value to a developer; create the modification to the specification given, test locally and report on the test process in order for this to be passed to the test team and then liaise with the user acceptence team for further tweaks/modifications before being signed off and released.</p>
<p>Starting out as junior developer; this was my first roll in the world of development. Then, at the age of 26 I wanted a career I can excel in and gain rewards on a basis I can control, be that daily, weekly or monthly. Here, I learnt PHP at a deeper level and started to move from procedural code to the MVC pattern but on a basic level.</p>
